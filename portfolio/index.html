            <article>
                <h3>My Passion</h3>
                <p>I develop reusable components by following coding standards and applying evolving technologies and best practices to reach business goals.</p>

                <p>Creating websites allows me to speak any language. Solving problems through type, space, and image is the most universal way to communicate. It's everything and anything; I appreciate every second of it.</p>
                        
                <p>I always stay motivated and chase my dreams. Creating something out of nothing is an amazing feeling that is constantly driving me forward to learn new skills.</p>
