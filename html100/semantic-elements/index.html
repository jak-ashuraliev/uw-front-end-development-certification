        <h1>HTML5 Sementic Elements</h1>
        <p>The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page. By adding semantic tags to our document, we provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content. That clarity is also communicated with search engines, ensuring that the right pages are delivered for the right queries. Furthermore, they help us build better site structures, and more importantly, they can improve websitesâ€™ accessibility. It improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents and help other programmers understand the structure of the webpage. In addition, it natively handles multimedia and graphical content, with the addition of the new elements, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVGs). </p>

        The HTML &lt; article &gt; element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

        <h3>The Blockquotes</h3>
        The &lt; blockquote &gt; tag in HTML is used to display the long quotations (a section that is quoted from another source). It changes the alignment to make it unique from others. It contains both opening and closing tags.
