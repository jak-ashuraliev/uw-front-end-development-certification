        <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>

        <h2>DC Heroes</h2>
        <p><em>DC Superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
            The storylines are more complex, <u>and often address real life social issiues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>
        
        <h3><small>Marvel Heroes</small></h3>
        <p><q>Marvel Superheroes comics feell more 2-dimentional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industruies, whereas DC attemps to capitalize on the TV and film industruies are more mediocre.</p>
        
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>But they do have decent moveis and TV shows.</p>
        <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool ad DC heroes.</blockquote>
